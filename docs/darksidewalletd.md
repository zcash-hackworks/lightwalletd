# Intro to darksidewalletd

Darksidewalletd is a feature included in lightwalletd, enabled by the
`--darkside-very-insecure` flag, which can serve arbitrary blocks to a zcash
light client wallet. This is useful for security and reorg testing. It includes
a minimally-functional mock zcashd which comes with a gRPC API for controlling
which blocks it will serve.

This means that you can use darksidewalletd to alter the sequence of blocks, the
blocks and information inside the blocks, and much more--then serve it to
a light client wallet to see how it behaves. Multiple wallets can connect to the
same darksidewalletd at the same time. Darksidewalletd should only be used for
testing, and therefore is hard-coded to shut down after 30 minutes of operation
to prevent accidental deployment as a server.

## Dependencies 

Lightwalletd and most dependencies of lightwalletd, including Go version 1.11 or
later, but not zcashd. Since Darksidewalletd mocks zcashd, it can run standalone
and does use zcashd to get blocks or send and receive transactions.

For the tutorial (and further testing) the tool grpcurl will be used to call the
API and set blocks.

## Overview
### Running darksidewalletd

To start darksidewalletd, you run lightwalletd with a flag:

`./lightwalletd --darkside-very-insecure`

To prevent accidental deployment in production, it will automatically shut off
after 30 minutes.

### Default set of blocks

There’s a file in the repo called ./testdata/default-darkside-blocks. This
contains the blocks darksidewalletd loads by default. The format of the file is
one hex-encoded block per line.

### Generating fake blocks with genblocks

Lightwalletd and the wallets themselves don’t actually perform any validation of
the blocks (beyond checking the blocks’ prevhashes, which is used to detect
reorgs). For information on block headers, see the zcash protocol specification.
That means the blocks we give darksidewalletd don’t need to be fully valid, see
table:


Block component|Must be valid|Must be partially valid|Not checked for validity 
:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----
nVersion|x| | 
hashPrevBlock|x| | 
hashMerkleRoot| | |x 
hashFinalSaplingRoot| | |x 
nTime| | |x 
nBits| | |x 
nNonce| | |x 
Equihash solution| | |x 
Transaction Data*| |x|  

\*Transactions in blocks must conform to the transaction format, but not need
valid zero-knowledge proofs etc.

There’s a tool to help with generating these fake just-barely-valid-enough
blocks, it’s called genblocks. To use it you create a directory of text files,
one file per block, and each line in the file is a hex-encoded transaction that
should go into that block:

```
mkdir blocksA
touch blocksA/{1000,1001,1002,1003,1004,1005}.txt
echo “some hex-encoded transaction you want to put in block 1003” > blocksA/1003.txt
```

This will output the blocks, one hex-encoded block per line (the same format as
./testdata/default-darkside-blocks). 

Tip: Because nothing is checking the full validity of transactions, you can get
any hex-encoded transaction you want from a block explorer and put those in the
block files. The sochain block explorer makes it easy to obtain the raw
transaction hex, by viewing the transaction (example), clicking “Raw Data”, then
copying the “tx_hex” field.

### Using DarksideSetState to submit a new set of blocks

As mentioned, the darksidewalletd PR adds an RPC, it’s called DarksideSetState,
which lets you control the blocks the mock zcashd is serving. Well, it would let
you if you could speak gRPC. If you want to do it manually (not part of some
test code) you can use a tool called grpcurl to call the API and set the blocks.
Once you have that installed, there’s a script in utils/submitblocks.sh to
submit the blocks, which internally uses grpcurl, e.g.:

```
./genblocks --blocks-dir blocksA > blocksA.txt
./utils/submitblocks.sh 1000 1000 blocksA.txt
```

In the submitblocks.sh command, the first “1000” is the height to serve the
first block at (so that if blocksA.txt contains 6 blocks they will be served as
heights 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, and 1005. If the genblocks tool was used
to create the blocksA file, then this argument must match what was given to
genblocks, otherwise the heights in the coinbase transactions will not match up
with the height lightwalletd is serving the blocks as. The second “1000” sets
the value that lightwalletd will report the sapling activation height to be.

Tip: The DarksideSetState expects a complete set of blocks for the mock zcashd
to serve, if you want to just add one block, for example, you need to re-submit
all of the blocks including the new one.

## Tutorial
### Triggering a Reorg

To begin following these instructions, build lightwalletd but do not start
darksidewalletd yet. If you started it during the overview above, kill the
server before starting the tutorial. 

We’ll use genblocks to generate the hex-encoded blocks, then
./utils/submitblocks.sh to get them into darksidewalletd. We’ll call the blocks
before the reorg “blocksA” and the blocks after the reorg “blocksB”:

```
mkdir blocksA
touch blocksA/{1000,1001,1002,1003,1004,1005}.txt
mkdir blocksB
touch blocksB/{1000,1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006}.txt
echo "0400008085202f8901950521a79e89ed418a4b506f42e9829739b1ca516d4c590bddb4465b4b347bb2000000006a4730440220142920f2a9240c5c64406668c9a16d223bd01db33a773beada7f9c9b930cf02b0220171cbee9232f9c5684eb918db70918e701b86813732871e1bec6fbfb38194f53012102975c020dd223263d2a9bfff2fa6004df4c07db9f01c531967546ef941e2fcfbffeffffff026daf9b00000000001976a91461af073e7679f06677c83aa48f205e4b98feb8d188ac61760356100000001976a91406f6b9a7e1525ee12fd77af9b94a54179785011b88ac4c880b007f880b000000000000000000000000" > blocksB/1004.txt
```

Use genblocks to put together the fake blocks:

```
./genblocks --blocks-dir blocksA > testdata/default-darkside-blocks
./genblocks --blocks-dir blocksB > testdata/darkside-blocks-reorg
```

(note: this is overwrites the file darksidewalletd loads by default, testdata/default-darkside-blocks)

Now you can start darksidewalletd and it’ll load the blocksA blocks:

`./lightwalletd --darkside-very-insecure`

That will have loaded and be serving the blocksA blocks. We can push up the
blocksB blocks using ./utils/submitblocks.sh:

`./utils/submitblocks.sh 1000 1000 testdata/darkside-blocks-reorg`

We should now see a reorg in server.log:

```
{"app":"frontend-grpc","duration":442279,"error":null,"level":"info","method":"/cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc.CompactTxStreamer/DarksideSetState","msg":"method called","peer_addr":{"IP":"127.0.0.1","Port":47636,"Zone":""},"time":"2020-03-23T13:59:41-06:00"}

```
